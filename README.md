# Machine-Learning-UiTM-Jasin

Supervised Learning using KNN Algorithm.

## Overview
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and supporting files for a supervised learning project using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It demonstrates data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## What’s included
- notebooks/
  - main_notebook.ipynb  (example: preprocessing, training, evaluation)
- data/
  - (place your dataset CSV files here; not included in repo if large)
- models/
  - (saved model files if any)
- README.md

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+ recommended
- Common libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter

Install dependencies (example):

pip install -r requirements.txt

If you don’t have a requirements file, install manually:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/aimanazhari2201/Machine-Learning-UiTM-Jasin.git
2. Change directory and start Jupyter Notebook or Lab:

   cd Machine-Learning-UiTM-Jasin
   jupyter notebook

3. Open the main notebook (e.g., main_notebook.ipynb) and run the cells in order.

## Dataset
Place your dataset CSV files in the `data/` directory. If your dataset contains sensitive information, remove it before pushing or add it to `.gitignore`.

## Results
The notebook includes code to output model metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix) and basic plots to visualize results.

## Make repository private (if needed)
If you want to prevent public access to this repository, go to: Settings → Danger Zone → Change repository visibility → Make private.

Note: making the repository private will not convert any public forks into private.
